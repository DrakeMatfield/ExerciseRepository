## My Personal Attitude 

I'm creating this windows application call Exercise Repository. I decided to create this app because of my need to quickly record my progress, and to be able to view the data in a meaningful way. But as an on going project, I perceive the project will develop other related purposes also.

The reason I decided to make it a public project; unlike, my other endeavor is because I don't have any intentions at this time to turn this project into a business venture. 

Furthermore, I have been battling my fitness goals all my life; and currently I decided to get back in shape to pursuit a relationship a female bodybuilder. I have always admire these athletic women; but I have never pursuit them because I believe I have no chance with one. But I figure I get back in shape maybe for the last time to fulfill a lifetime dream of being with one of these women.

Nevertheless, if I find usefulness in this project I sure other might as well, and this can be part of my contribution to the bodybuilder's community; and therefore, I might gain some respect in the female's eye in the community.
